# NeoCura-Healthcare_LLM
## Overview
The **Personalized Healthcare LLM** is designed to recommend personalized healthcare solutions based on multiple datasets. The system leverages machine learning techniques to provide tailored medicine and healthcare recommendations based on user input.

## Features
- Utilizes multiple datasets to provide accurate recommendations
- Machine learning-based personalized healthcare suggestions
- Supports hybrid recommendation techniques
- Customizable for different healthcare applications

## Dataset
The project integrates multiple datasets, each containing information related to healthcare, medicines, symptoms, and treatments. These datasets help in making precise recommendations for users based on their health conditions.

## Installation
